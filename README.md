How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by compartmentalizing my work. I try to take a big project and break it down into realistic goals and steps that will achieve my final goal 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has helped me to craft my 3D modeling skills. shapes, scaling, texturing, and lighting are all aspects of this. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I created my objects and oriented them in my 3D space first. Then I applied textures and color. Lastly I applied lighting. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics from my design approach could be applied to any graphics and visualization work that I might encounter in the future. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I work in iterations and take breaks when I get stuck. Asking for help and finding mentors for issues that I could not resolve on my own was essential. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Because working with openGL isn't as common as many other areas of computer science, I had to do a lot of self teaching. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
It took me many iterations to get my finished project. Iterations were important because you can't do it all in one stretch. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I had to humble myself and ask for help. I found a tutor who tought me a lot of skills that I may not have learned as easily on my own. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will help me to land a career position in the future that gives me a better work/life balance and overall better quality of life. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Knowing the basics of computational graphics and visualization will help me in the future if I ever encounter the field again. It's good to know that I have a solid understanding of how it works, and that understanding could help me solve problems in the future. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The skills that I learned in this course will help me navigate any professional situation that might involve graphics and visualization. I don't see graphics and visualization applications in my professional pathway at the moment, but it's nice to know that if I ever do encounter it again in the future that I won't be totally clueless.
